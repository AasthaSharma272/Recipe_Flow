Recipe Flow
Created By: Aastha, Dua, Farah, Maleeha, Seedak
- The domain of our project is Recipe Organization.
- Our proposed software serves as a platform where users can browse recipes generated from the Edamam Recipe Search API, as well as upload recipes of their own for personal viewing. Users are also able to save recipes to their profile to view later.
- Users can search for specific recipes using various filters (e.g. vegan, peanut-free) as well as enter recipe names into a searchbox. This allows them narrow down their recipe search to what is useful to them. Search results are generated by making API calls using the specific requirements and restictons collected from the user input and then displaying the returned recipes.
- Users are able to upload personal recipes, including a recipe name, ingredients, and instructions as well as giving them the ability to upload a recipe image if they choose to. Uploaded recipes can be accessed from the user's Profile page.
- When a user clicks on a recipe, they can choose to save it, adding it to their Saved Recipes collection that can be located on their Profile page. 
- Our software follows the Observer and Simply Factory Design Principles as well as The Open and Closed, Interface Segregation, and Single Responsibility SOLID Principles.
