# Group99_Project207

- The domain of our project is Recipe Organization.
- Our proposed software will serve as a hub where users can browse recipes initially uploaded 
from the API we are using and then explore recipes posted by other users as well as post recipes 
of their own, and save recipes for later.
- Users will be able to search for recipes based on specifications of their choosing 
(e.g. vegan, gluten-free) to help them narrow down their recipe search to what is useful to them.
